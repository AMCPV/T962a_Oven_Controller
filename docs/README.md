# T962a Oven Controller Upgrade

This is a replacement controller for a T962a Oven.  
It consists of a complete replacement for the hardware in a compatible form with software providing extended features.

**Features**  
* Supports the two internal thermocouples  
* Support up to two external thermocouples (with expansion board)  
* Supports up to 10 profiles stored in non-voltile memory  
* The current configuration is also stored in non-voltile memory  
* Uses additional SSD to completely separate the low-voltage and high-voltage components  

**Requirements**  
* It uses a Kinetis microcontroller so requires a compatible programmer e.g. USBDM  
* Firmware development requires Eclipse/KDS and USBDM plugin
